## Installing dependencies

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
npm i
```

## Developing



Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a front-end development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Strat fake json server (aviable on localhost:3000):

```bash
npm run server
```

or run them both:

```bash
npm start
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
